Bug fix: now loads categories with saved entries from D-Bus

0.6.2.1 (18th May 2008):

Build system: adds workaround for failure of CMake 2.4 to include and link
the Qt DBus module (causing packages to not build on most recent Linux
distros).

0.6.2 (17th May 2008):

New feature: D-Bus interface, allowing other programs to utilise QTM's
quickpost feature and to open saved or blank documents
Bug fix: "New entry on startup" in the system tray icon works again

0.6.1 (14th May 2008):

New feature: now includes user agent string when making HTTP requests, so
that QTM shows up in web server statistics
Improvement: now uses a QPlainTextEdit on Qt 4.4, rather than the heavier
old QTextEdit, as console and editor widgets
Search widget: can now interact with a QPlainTextEdit as well as an old 
QTextEdit
Build system: building universal binaries no longer the default as it is
really only necessary for distributors, not end users building from source
Build system: version number now inserted into the program dynamically,
using a define in a header built by a shell script/batch file
Bug fix: stopped loading of system-try icon image on the Mac, where it is
not displayed

0.6.0.2 (8th May 2008):

Bug fix: removed "skip rpath" line in the CMake build file, so that it is
possible again to link against sandboxed local installs of Qt.
Bug fix: hid unused widget labelled "Trackback this entry" in the side panel
of the main window

0.6.0.1 (27th April 2008):

Comptibility: restored compatibility with Qt 4.2 by removing Qt 4.3 layout
features.

0.6 (22nd April 2008):

New feature: ability to quickpost articles downloaded through HTTPS as well
as HTTP (requires Qt 4.3, doesn't work on Windows, at least not out of the
box)
User interface: new yellow system-tray icon displayed while quickpost is in
progress (Windows only)
User interface: now displays busy cursors when posting blog entries or
refreshing blog or category lists
Improvement: when setting the title of a new quickpost article, sets the
window title to it as well
Bug fix: now displays categories in proper alphabetical order, with shorter
entries (e.g. KDE) appearing before longer ones (e.g. KDE Apps)
Bug fix: now checks for and, if necessary, creates the local storage
directory before writing the templates file

0.6 beta 1 or 0.5.90 (7th April 2008):

Installer: new Nullsoft Windows installer
New feature: blog lists and categories are saved from session to session
until the blog list is refreshed or the account changed, so that lists
are not refreshed every time a new blog is selected
New feature: can now load entry files from the command line
Compatibility: regex searching in the documents now disabled on Qt 4.1
which doesn't offer the required methods

0.5.8.2 (24th February 2008):

Build system: Enabled out-of-directory builds (patch by Patryk Cisek)
Build system: Now inserts date into manpage automatically, rather than
having to be inserted manually
Bug fix: Category selectors now show categories in proper alphabetical
order, without prioritising uppercase (like abbreviations)
UI improvement: Title field now takes keyboard focus when a fresh window 
is shown

0.5.8.1 (17th February 2008):

Bug fix: The search bar actually stops using expert (i.e. regex-based) Find
when it is disabled through the setExpertEnabled slot (in QTM's case,
through the "Enable expert search preference)

0.5.8 (15th February 2008):

New feature: A search bar, similar to that in Firefox (but actually largely
derived from Qt Assistant)
Bug fix: When loading entries from files, now displays the blog name in the
selector rather than its ID.

0.5.7.1 (10th February 2008):

New feature: Copy title extended to allow non-template quickposts to use
this feature (set in general preferences).  In addition, if this is set, it
becomes the default for the Copy Title option in new QP templates (and the
reverse if it is not).
Unix: Now includes manpage (rudimentary, to satisfy Debian packaging
guidelines).

0.5.7 (7th February 2008):

New feature: "Copy title", allowing the user to automatically name an entry
after the online resource it is based on when quickposting
Improvement: now sorts the categories alphabetically, rather than in the
apparent non-order in which they have previously appeared
Improvement: unedited, fresh Quickposts are no longer "dirty", i.e. if user
tries to close the window, if will not prompt him to save
Removed: accept and reset buttons in the Quickpost Template configuration
dialog; a new template is now "accepted" if any details are entered, while
reset had intractable bugs and can be achieved in any case by cancelling and
reopening the dialog
User interface: added What's This help to the preference item "Save
passwords with entries"

0.5.6.1 (21st October 2007):

Bug fix: bug in associated hosts system, by which empty associated hosts
entries were trapping the // marker in URLs (and thus causing QTM to use the
wrong templates) fixed.

0.5.6 (20th October 2007):

New feature: "associated hosts" in quickpost templates.  The user can
specify a number of hosts in a template, and when he then quickposts an
article with that hostname in the URL, that template will be used.
Improvement: two new template tags: %host% (which is just the hostname of a
page being blogged) and %domain% (which is %host% without the www.).
Bug fix: fixed crashes when shutting the quickpost template config window
when there are no templates.
Build system: fixed relinking behaviour; no longer relinks when QDEBUG is
not set (from CMake command line).

0.5.5 (6th October 2007):

Bug fix: restored compatibility with Qt 4.1 (v0.5.4 had required Qt 4.3, due
to my using Qt Designer 4.3 for designing some widgets)
User interface: Added application icons for menus and the Mac OS X dock
Build system: now uses shell script to generate the X11 desktop entry file
at build time, so that it specifies where exactly the executable and icons
are.

0.5.4 (25th August 2007):

Security: no longer outputs passwords to the console when displaying XML-RPC
listings
New feature: now stores titles and targets for auto links
New feature: ability to clear the console
Improvement: now does base 64 conversions internally, with progress dialog,
rather than the old method of using Qt's built-in converter which blocked
the GUI.
Bug fix: no longer outputs entire encoded file to console when uploading a
file (caused crash)
Bug fix: now detects faults in file upload responses accurately and displays
"406" errors on console as HTML code, not as "displayed" HTML

0.5.4 (beta 2) (1st July 2007):

New feature: Auto link, allowing a certain URL to be associated with a
certain word, so that the author can highlight that word, click Auto link,
and the link to that URL will appear.  (Note: at the moment, it does not
store the title or target.)

0.5.4-beta1 (20th June 2007):

New feature: File upload implemented.  A file can be uploaded, using an
XML-RPC method (metaWeblog.newMediaObject), in Base64 format.  This uses a
blocking base-64 converter which is part of Qt's QByteArray class, and
causes the program to hang while the conversion is going on (noticeable on
large files such as images).

0.5.3 (18th June 2007):

Removed feature: Blogger support.  Blogger no longer supports the APIs that
QTM uses.
New feature: Abort, which stops the current network job (refresh blog or
category list, blog entry posting or whatever)
New features: New variants on Paste: paste as ordered/unordered list, marked
paragraphs (with <p> tags), normal blockquotes and Markdown blockquotes, and
ability to mark up a block as an ordered or unordered list.
New feature: Ability to set whether to submit a date and time or not at
posting time, to avoid clock skews (problem on Wordpress and Textpattern, not
on MT).
New feature: Ability to set the post's remote categories explicitly, through
action "Send categories" in File menu
Build system: Fixed relinking issue at install time, in which (on sandboxed
installs of Qt 4.3.0) the executable was relinked to the normal install of
Qt, even if it was older than 4.3 (causing unresolved symbol errors).
Bug fix: now saves entry numbers when saving entries, so that you can reopen
a posted entry and have QTM post an edit, rather than a new post.
User interface: removed (from view) the unused actions, Print and "Close and
delete".

0.5.2 (20th May 2007):

New feature: Drupal compatibility.  This had always been mentioned in the
documentation, but certain practices, such as identifying blogs and
categories using Movable Type patterns which are not replicated in Drupal,
were preventing Drupal compatibility.  In particular, blogs in MT are the
equivalent of content types in Drupal, and are identified by strings rather
than numbers.
Improvement: now strips whitespaces from titles in Quickposts (Qt 4.2+)
Improvement: now always rebuilds when posting an entry to an MT blog (using
mt.publishPost method)
Qt 4.3: now gives alerts when opening up windows (esp. on Mac, where the
icon bounces)
Bug fix: when quitting, looks for QTM main windows specifically, rather than
visible widgets in general (this was preventing quitting on Qt 4.3)
Build system: Mac users can specify non-universality with a CMake option,
rather than by commenting out a line in CMakeLists.txt
Build system: Location of desktop spec file (qtm.desktop) can be specified
at configure time; category list now includes
X-MandrivaLinux-Internet-Other
Bug fix: menu entry to view TB ping list now works (also has Ctrl+5
shortcut)

0.5.1.2 (8th May 2007):

Bug fix: fixed a crash which happened when processing XML-RPC responses to
category requests to blogs which have no categories - such as Drupal content
types with no taxonomies.  This makes for Drupal compatibility.

0.5.1.1 (7th May 2007):

Bug fix: fixed a crash which happened when doing a templateless quickpost. 
This was caused by trying to fetch the default publish status for a
non-existent template.

0.5.1 (6th May 2007):

User interface: the system-tray icon no longer displays on the Mac. 
Instead, the same menu is displayed by double-clicking on the dock icon.  A
bare-bones default main menu, with New, Open and Quit functions (the latter
displayed in the dock and application menus), appears when there is no
top-level window present on the Mac (only on Qt 4.2; this may change in
future releases).
User interface: the Abort Quick Post action in the STI menu appears (albeit
greyed out) even when it is disabled; this is to get round a bug in Qt on
the Mac
New feature: the user can now reset changes made to quickpost templates
before closing the dialog (Qt 4.2 only)
New feature: option to "treat posting as saving" - in other words, when this
is on, if you write a post and post it (draft or publish) and then try to
close the window, QTM will not ask you if you want to save it.
New feature: in Quickpost Templates (Qt 4.2), to set whether posts written 
using a given template should be draft or publish (or simply to use the 
default setting)
New feature: qtm.desktop file, which provides a KDE/GNOME menu entry on
platforms which support it

0.5.0.1 (12th April 2007):

Bug fix: All qDebugs (causing console output) commented out and use of the
macro QT_NO_DEBUG_OUTPUT stopped (this caused compile failure on Debian
Etch, which uses Qt 4.2.1)
Bug fix: the Qt Designer file for the main window (CatkinMainWindow.ui) now
has a new version (CatkinMainWindow41.ui) for Qt 4.1.

0.5 (25th March 2007):

Bug fix: Quit now works (from system-tray icon and File menu) on Windows
(tested on XP only)
Improvement: Newlines now stripped from title of a quickposted article (some
websites have newlines in their page titles, eg. telegraph.co.uk)
Bug fix: Various memory leaks (dialogs undeleted) fixed

0.5 RC1 (19th March 2007):

User interface: New keyboard shortcuts for new, open and save in File menu,
and Mac standard Ctrl+comma for preferences is now present on all platforms
Bug fix: App now has Quit action in the main application menu, and the quit
actions there and in the STI actually work (as they didn't in the beta)
Bug fix: Removed a few more references to Catkin QTM
Bug fix: Debug-related console output stopped, unless debug is specifically
enabled at CMake stage

0.5-beta1 (10th March 2007):

The app is now called QTM throughout, rather than Catkin QTM (a remnant of
the old Catkin client for Blosxom), except in the internal application name,
which is maintained so that it finds config files correctly
New feature: Quickpost templates, which can be set-up and used through the
system tray icon (req. Qt 4.2)
New feature: The user can send trackback pings from QTM (4.1 & 4.2)
Bug fix: App crashed after closing prefs dialog when system tray icon was in
use (4.2)
Bug fix: Now shuts down when the Quit option is chosen from the STI on the
Mac (so the STI is now viable on the Mac) (4.2)

0.4 (14th January 2007):

New feature: Quickpost, the ability to use the system-tray icon to post the
contents of the clipboard or, on X11, the mouse selection. (Qt 4.2 only)
User interface: the "round" icon (susesystray.xpm), introduced for SUSE 10.2 
binary in 0.3.10, is now standard on X11.
Bug fix: Program no longer sporadically echoes various debugging information
to the console (achieved by commenting out all qDebug lines)

0.3.10 (12th December 2006):

Bug fix: the warning message which was being displayed while requesting
missing passwords for entries loaded from files is now gone.
Build change: the useSTI.h header file is gone; to compile with the system
tray icon (recommended on KDE/GNOME, absolutely not on Mac OS X), build as
follows: cmake -D USE_STI:BOOL=TRUE . (the dot is necessary and represents
the current directory).  Otherwise, cmake . as before.

0.3.10-beta1 (12th November 2006):

QTM can now post to Blogger blogs (however, the posts have to be *displayed*
from within the Blogger web interface; this is a problem at Blogger's end
and affects other similar applications).
Added system tray icon which can presently start a new entry, open a saved
one and quit the application.  This is supported by Qt 4.2 only and can be
activated, or de-activated, by editing the file useSTI.h.  Not recommended
for use on Windows and Mac OS X.
Fonts for editing, previewing and the console now set using Qt 4.2 font
combos when built on a system with Qt 4.2.
Now possible to set the console font (from the Edit menu on Qt 4.1, from the
prefs dialog on 4.2)
Redesigned the preferences dialog on 4.2 (the old one, albeit with new
options, is present on 4.1)
User can now set whether to allow comments and TBs by default in the prefs
window
Bug fix: fixed crash when occurred when the program attempted to access
non-existent web servers or services.

0.3.9.1 (2nd September 2006):
Bug fix: fixed signal-slot mismatch which was preventing the host lookup
added in 0.3.9 being acted upon.  (Note: there are still some ways of making
the app crash by getting it to post to non-existent web servers or services. 
I intend to fix this in the forthcoming 0.3.10 release.)
(3rd Sept) Included CMakeLists.txt file for building QTM using CMake.

0.3.9 (24th August 2006):
The application now uses DOM to generate all submissions to the web service,
in order to make proper encoding more reliable.
Bug fix: the application now stops when the web service is not found or
refuses access (eg. due to the user supplying the wrong password).  This had
been the cause of crashes in the past.

0.3.8.2 (7th August 2006):
Bug fix: removed line which was causing the previewer, not the editor, to
appear when starting up
Bug fix: preventing switching from console to previewer and vice versa, as
it was impossible to switch back to the editor.  One can now only enact
either the previewer or the console from the editor.

0.3.8.1 (6th August 2006):
Bug fix: blocked network actions when app starts up with no account details
(to block routes to crash bug otherwise fixed in 0.3.8).

0.3.8 (6th August 2006):
Feature: added the ability to forget account details with one click of a
push button.
Bug fix: when there are no account details present, all routes to network
access are now blocked.  This is because they caused the program to crash
(such as when the user deleted his account details by hand and then closed
the preferences dialog; the program would try to refresh the blog and
category lists, causing the crash).

0.3.7 (3rd July 2006):
Feature: directory browse button in the preferences dialog enabled
Feature: possible to use right mouse button in the location space in the
prefs dialog to insert custom filenames mt-xmlrpc.cgi and xmlrpc.php (common
XML-RPC receivers)

0.3.6 (3rd July 2006):
Bug fix: categories now set properly when loading an entry
Bug fix: status bar errors no longer appear when changing blogs (and just
after start-up)
Bug fix: UK pound signs now encoded
Improvement: QTM now prompts for a password when loading an entry saved
without one (and then sets the categories properly)
Improvement: QTM no longer refreshes the blog list if the server and
location are the same after the preferences dialog has been used
Feature: new toolbar button to mark a block of text as blockquote

0.3.5 (13th June 2006):
Bug fix: QTM now changes tildes in the drafts directory to the actual path of the
home directory, compensating from the failure of the QFileDialog to convert
them.
Feature: ability to set the font used in the entry preview
Feature: ability to mark up a block of text as a blockquote

0.3.4 (3rd June 2006):
Feature: program now monitors when text has not been saved, and prompts the
writer to save before closing a window or opening a new file in that window
Improvement: now possible to open the font selection dialog from the prefs
dialog
Bug fix: "open file" dialog now looks in correct directory
Bug fix: added line to the project file to explicitly make it a release
project file (as on some OS's it was looking for debug libraries).

0.3.3 (28th May 2006):
Feature: now possible to set the editor font, and for this to be saved to
the application's preferences.

0.3.2 (26th May 2006):
Feature: Support for Technorati tags, which can be saved to disk with an
entry and posted at the start *or end* of a main entry body
Bug fix: Edits now submit properly on Wordpress blogs (as dates sent as ISO
dates and not strings)
Bug fix: Ampersands and other special characters properly encoded
end of a main entry

0.3.1 (14th March 2006):
User can now add RSS excerpt
Left panel redesigned with less clutter and more room, using multi-page Qt
widget
Bugs fixed, including one which caused HTML tags to be submitted as
plain-text "sample tags"

0.3 (8th March 2006):
Toolbar set to display icons only to get around Qt 4.1.1's problem of
resizing text when an action is toggled (as with the Preview button).
Italic and bold icons tidied up a little bit

0.3 beta 2 (28th Feb 2006):
Save and load implemented (beta 1)
Now possible to choose whether to save a password with a saved entry

2006-01-28:
Now possible to edit and resubmit as edits
Now possible to open new editing windows
Some unused actions greyed out in menus and toolbars
