QTM, version 0.7
Copyright 2008, Matthew J Smith
This program is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
version 2.  This applies to all files written by me, or produced by me by
the use of tools like Qt Designer, in this package, and any binary produced
using them.

QTM allows the user to compose, format and submit entries to MT and
Wordpress blogs (and possibly other content management systems using the
same interfaces; your mileage may vary).  It uses the standard Blogger,
MetaWeblog and Movable Type APIs.  It requires Qt 4.1.  Presently this is
available from Trolltech as a Windows installer, and from sources of Linux
distributions, and sometimes from third parties, as RPM or .deb packages.
Although the interfaces used for connecting to the blog server are XML-RPC 
based, it does not require any special libraries for this; it uses Qt's 
own network classes.

As for QTM's present capabilities, it is possible to compose, format, 
preview and submit blog entries in either one category or several -
as with Movable Type's QuickPost feature.  Entries may be saved to disk,
with or without a password.

For installation instructions, see the separate file INSTALL.

Issues:

(1) There are known to be problems with some versions of Qt's text 
editor widget; in the case of early 4.1.* versions, the problem is 
slowness, and on version 4.2 the problem is not displaying the bottom of 
the widget's text when a scrollbar is added.  This problem is replicated
in the QPlainTextEdit widget in Qt 4.4 at the time of this writing; I
recommend using QTextEdit (by configuring with the option DONT_USE_PTE
set to TRUE).

(2) When using QuickPost to copy multiple paragraphs of text from a web 
page into a new entry, you may find that there is no blank line between
paragraphs, just a single carriage return.  This may be fixed in a future
release.

(3) When posting an entry, your categories may not be posted; specifically
it may update the blog's category list rather than post those you chose for
the entry to hand.  If you find your post has not been categorised, use the
"Update this post's categories" entry in the File menu.

(4) When compiling on some distributions, notably OpenSUSE 10.3 and 11, you 
will notice dozens of warnings relating to "deprecated conversions" of one 
string type to another.  You should ignore these, although I intend to fix 
it in a future release.

(5) When using a version of QTM compiled with Qt 4.4 on Windows Vista, you
may find that the system-tray icon menu does not display properly when you
right-click it.  This seems to be a problem with the menu clashing with the
widget bar.  You may find it preferable to move the widget bar, or to use Qt
4.3 instead.  For the time being, installers for Windows will come with Qt
4.3.

Any enquiries and suggestions to me at indigojo@blogistan.co.uk.  Please, no
requests for the normal features of blog managers like ecto - most of these
are on my wish list anyway.
